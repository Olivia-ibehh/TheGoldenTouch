        <h2>Why is this movement so important?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="ParagraphOne">
      <p>This is Important because for many years in the beauty industry Women of color have not been represented. We have always been intoduced
        To European beauty standards but not being able to find the beauty in our own cultute and beauty. Throughout the makeup industry you have probably
        not seen many Women of Color being represented until receantly in 2017 when Rihanna set the standard with her Fenty Brand come out with 40 different
        Shades of foundation. The Fenty Brand set the makeup industryto high standards for including women of color in their media to promite their products
        espically for items like foundation, concealer, and countouring. Before the Fenty Brand came along, there have been many companies like Beauty Bakerie
        and other Women of Color owned brands making the big stage in makeup and helping support the movement of Women of Color being represented in the
        makeup industry. Influcers on social media that are Women of Color are using their platform to make big name brands represent women of color wether it is
        doing collborations, look with their products or callling them out to fix a situation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ParagraphTwo">
      <p> The purpose of the Golden Touch is to help Women of Color intresed in makeup get an experience of exporing what is right for them in terms of what to
        put on their face, influencers to look out for, where they can get their prouducts, events in their area that hold events for makeup, or looks they can do for their skin tone.
        we need more representation for Women of color in the beauty insdustry because we are just as beautiful as anyone else and we have our own creativity to bring to this world.</p>
